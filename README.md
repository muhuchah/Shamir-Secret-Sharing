# Secret Sharing Using Polynomial Interpolation
This project demonstrates a simple implementation of Shamir's Secret Sharing scheme using polynomial interpolation in C++.

# Overview
Shamir's Secret Sharing is a method to split a secret into multiple parts (shares) which can then be distributed among a group of people. The secret can only be reconstructed when a sufficient number of shares (threshold) are combined together.

In this implementation:
  - A secret integer is divided into n shares using polynomial interpolation over a finite field defined by MOD.
  - The polynomial is constructed such that its coefficients are random numbers.
  - Shares are generated by evaluating the polynomial at different points.
  - To reconstruct the secret, a minimum of t shares are required. This is achieved using Lagrange interpolation.

# Usage

  1. Compilation:
        - Ensure you have CMake installed.
        - Navigate to the project directory and create a build directory.
        - Inside the build directory, run:
     

        ```
          cmake ..
          make
        ```

  2. Execution:
        - Run the compiled executable:
     
        ```
          ./SecretSharing
        ```
  
3. Input:
    - Follow the prompts to imput the number of people (n), the modulus (MOD), the secret integer, and threshold (t).

5. Output:           
    - The program will generate shares and display them.
    - Enter at least t shares to reconstruct the secret.
    - The reconstructed secret will be displayed.

# Example
Consider an example where n = 5, MOD = 257, secret = 1234, and t = 3:

- Shares will be generated for n = 5 people.
- At least t = 3 shares will be required to reconstruct the secret.
